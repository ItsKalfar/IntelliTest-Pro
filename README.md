# Approach and Development Journey

## IntelliTestPro Approach and Development Journey Problem Statement Breakdown

I approached the development of IntelliTestPro by breaking down the problem statement into four key steps, ensuring a systematic and effective solution:

1. Handling Multiple PDF Inputs:

   - Implemented the ability to process multiple PDF files as inputs, allowing teachers to interact with various documents seamlessly.

2. Generating Embeddings from PDF Content:
   - Utilized text embedding AI model to convert PDF content into meaningful vector representations, enhancing the understanding of the document's context.
3. Efficient Data Storage:
   - Implemented a structured data storage approach:
     - Used NeonDB to store user profiles and chat data securely.
     - Employed AWS S3 for the secure storage of PDF files.
     - Leveraged Pinecone to store text embeddings, optimizing data retrieval and analysis.
4. Building a User-Friendly Chat Interface:
   - Developed an intuitive chat interface, enabling users to send requests to an AI model for dynamic and interactive conversations with PDF documents.

## Model Selection and Exploration

In the development process, I explored various closed-source and open-source models, including both text generation and text-to-text (question-answering) models. The selection of the final model was a critical decision, realizing that the quality of our product greatly hinges on the AI model's capabilities.

## Exploration of Vector Databases and Text Embeddings

An exciting aspect of the development journey was the exploration of vector databases and text embeddings. Understanding and implementing these technologies contributed significantly to the efficiency and effectiveness of IntelliTestPro.

## Future Plans

Looking ahead, I plan to integrate Stripe for secure transactions, enhancing the platform's capabilities. To ensure a robust and user-friendly experience, I aim to test the application live in production with a small user group of 10-20 users. This real-world testing will provide valuable insights and help refine the product for broader use.
